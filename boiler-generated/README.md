# Boiler Generated
This crate contains generated files for the boiler crate.

## Rebuilding Protobuf
You do not need to rebuild the files unless you change the .proto files! Follow
the instructions for the protobuf crate to set up protobuf-to-rust generation,
then run `./buildproto`. No windows instructions yet, this may run on mingw but
is untested.
